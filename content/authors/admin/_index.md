My name is Tianhao Cheng. I'm currently working on my masters in Computer Science and Technology in Fudan University. I am  interested in AI and especially multi-modal technologies. I am also currently learning cutting-edge AI algorithms and infrastructure, including CV/NLP models and distributed training/inference system. It is awesome to make AI accessible to everyone!
